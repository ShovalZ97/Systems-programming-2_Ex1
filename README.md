# ADT
In this assignment we implemented a general adaptive array in the C language.
An adaptive array is an array that changes its size so that any reference to a negative index is normal. When you refer to an index where no value has been placed then NULL is returned
The following commands can be run so that it can be seen that there are no compilation errors, runtime errors or memory leaks:
	
<div dir='ltr'>

    make demo
	make run
    make mem_test
</div>
	
 # OutPut
